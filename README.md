# CNN-tutorials
This repo contains summaries of basic CNN-related topics that I think are important.  
I'm keeping a record of them here so that later on, if I need them, it will be easy to come back and find them here. However, feel free to use them for your own study if you'd like.  
For now I am only summarising other people's teaching material (so I don't have to go back and watch that 5-hour tutorial again if I forget something). Sources/authors have been properly attributed when needed.
