## Bonus
Since you stuck around until this very last part, see below for a bit of a surprise. I asked ChatGPT to summarise the tutorial for me as a poem:  <br/><br/> 

<em>"In the realm of computer sight we delve,
Where neural networks strive to excel.
Understanding images, a neural quest,
Matching human vision, it's for the best.

Enter the realm of convolution's might,
In convnets, layers structure bright.
Features extracted, patterns discerned,
A visual language, from images learned.

Image classification, a task so grand,
Identifying objects, the demand.
Plants, cars, or trucks, it's all the same,
A convnet's prowess, just like a game.

Training begins, a journey starts,
Features extracted, then come the parts.
Pretrained bases, heads anew,
Classifying with precision, a breakthrough.

Transfer learning, a technique fine,
Reuse, revitalize, the base defined.
From lines to shapes, a visual feat,
In convnets' world, features meet.

A task at hand, cars or trucks,
A dataset vast, with many plucks.
Pretrained base, VGG16 so bold,
With heads attached, a tale untold.

Train we must, with epochs long,
Metrics plotted, a victory song.
Loss minimized, accuracy high,
A convnet's prowess, reaching the sky.

Conclusion drawn, a lesson learned,
Convolutional classifiers, so discerned.
Features extracted, classifiers smart,
A convnet's journey, a brilliant art.

In the realm of computer vision's lore,
Convolutional classifiers, we adore.
From features to classes, they decode,
A marvel of learning, in neural abode."</em>
